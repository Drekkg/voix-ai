# Voix-ai
Voix-ai is a website designed to drive traffic to an A.I voice modelling service.
The website is aimed at content creators, whether it is somebody making YouTube videos, product promotional vidoes
or audio books - in fact anybody that needs audio narration.
After landing on the home page the user would click on the link to the samples. After listenig to the samples,
and being suitably impressed, they would then signup for a free account, which would acquaint the user with the functionality and usefulness of Voix-ai. Professional and frequent users would become monthly subscribers.

 ## Testing
 Voix-ai the website was tested on a variety of physical devices: Laptops, larger 27 inch monitors, various Android phones and Tablets. Where it loooked and performed as expected on a variety of browsers(Edge, Chrome, Firefox, Samsung browser). Responsiveness was tested in Google chrome using numerous of simulated devices(Apple iphones, ipads, Google Phones and Samsung).

 The Github deployed site was checked many times, mainly on mobile devices.
 The site was called up and the landing page was checked for legibility and responsiveness. The links in the header were clicked to ensure the appropriate page was opended. The sample link took me to the samples.html page. The signup link to signup.html. The logo-link in the header also works on all pages and takes the user back to the landing page. The samples all work and play in all browsers and on all devices tested. The sign up form works and requires valid input in all fields. The email field requires an @ sign and trailing letters. After a successful sign up the thank you page is displayed. The thankyou page responsiveness is not 100percent to my liking. It looks and works great on mobile, but on larger screens the image is a little large. 
 The "Click here for Samples" button also didn't work a few times - the problem was tracked to some invalid html and solved(More in Bugs section).

 ## HTML Validation
 The HTML was validated using NU HTML Validator.
